Important:

  Conversions beginning today (perhaps from last
several days, if they'd been run .. they had not)
fail, due to expansion of the worksheet beyond
256 columns.

  Unknown just how they fail.

  The data beyond 256 columns may be simply dropped,
with no other harms to the converted file.

  This has not been explored.
