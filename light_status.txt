  tests run on converted files around 00:22z 31 March; no glaring errors seen.

  Some percentiles are nonsense figures, as when going from 0 hospitalized cases, to 2.
  These are represented as a hard zero (no cell formula).  Generally after the fact
  (after a cookie-cutter cell formula was applied, and gave nonsense as output).
  Rectifying this is left as an exercise for the user of the spreadsheet. ;)

  New category wrt no known address seen with 30 March press release (Governor, CT)

  USA stats generally 1-3 days behind CT stats, as it is desirable to edit
  this just once per (settled) calendar date.

  Negative percentiles were reformatted to be represented as enclosed in parens.

  First noted: .CSV seems to export all formulas to hard numbers!  Was not
  expecting that.
