Some graphs have a scaled X axis; to get them to
correspond with real data, their range is specified.

Since no exact mathematics was ever done to scale
them along integer divisions, this creates a small
problem with scaling an arbitrary length integer
line segment to correspond with real data intercepts.

And this is why producing new graphs with new scalings
takes time and effort to do well.

In general, the very first X axis specified rules the
graph overall (provides automatic resizing on the
X axis to fit in all the data, including reserving
space for future entries, when this is desirable).
