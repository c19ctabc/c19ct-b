# New Format Beginning 4 June (published) on 1 June (dataset)

This spreadsheet has a new format, with added columns.
Stepping was 7 columns across and is now 11.

Where there was 'Confirmed' now there is three:
'Total confirmed' 'Confirmed' 'Probable' (the Total
is to the left of the other two and is a total
of those two).

So that's four columns of increase per County
(exchanging one column for three in two places:
Lab Confirmed Cases; Cause of Death confirmed
or probable).

The checksumming appears to be working acceptably
well, but data is presently being edited in-situ.

Still most ideas got translated (seemingly correctly)
into cell-relationship formulae, so propagation
seems accessible (not as easy as it once was, of
course).

SO THIS branch is here to keep this 'experiment'
out of the dependency lineage for a few days,
anyway, if regrets become deep enough to want to
undo it. ;)

  With a decent glance at the entire repository, in 'gitk'
  it seems evident that the current file will indeed become
  the permanent version (no obvious reasons to back away
  from it, and it contains all improvements intended to be
  kept/propagated forward in time).  -author
